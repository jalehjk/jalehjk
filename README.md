# Hi, I’m Jaleh 👋

I’m an MSc graduate in Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics based in London.  
I work on applied machine learning and explainable AI, mostly in:

- 🩺 **Healthcare** – clinical risk prediction, EHR modelling
- 💸 **Financial & operational decisions** – loan approval, process optimisation
- ⚗️ **Pharma & R&D** – solubility prediction and experimental support

I like problems where models have to be **reliable, interpretable, and actually used by people**.

## 🔧 Tech

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **ML**: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, feature engineering, model validation  
- **XAI**: SHAP, LIME  
- **LLMs / RAG**: LangChain + OpenAI, retrieval, basic evaluations  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter/Colab, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧪 Selected Projects

- **Diabetes Risk Prediction with XAI** – EHR data → ML & deep models (LSTM, CNN) → SHAP/LIME explanations for clinicians.
- **Explainable Loan Approval with RAG** – XGBoost + SHAP + policy-grounded RAG to justify SME loan decisions.
- **Solubility Prediction Demo** – ML model on public compound data, including feature importance and error analysis.
- **Financial Process ML Prototype** – Baseline models on process/transaction data to highlight bottlenecks and anomalies.

I’m currently looking for data science / AI roles in the UK & Europe.
